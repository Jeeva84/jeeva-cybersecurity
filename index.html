<!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->
<section class="container" id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
I am a highly motivated cybersecurity professional with strong hands-on experience in threat detection, security operations, and incident response. With a foundation built on formal education, industry-recognized certifications, and real-world projects, I bring a practical, resilient, and results-driven approach to cybersecurity challenges.
</p>
<p>
My journey has been shaped by perseverance and passion. After moving to Canada, I took on multiple jobs to support my family while simultaneously pursuing my long-standing dream of working in cybersecurity. Balancing work, studies, and family responsibilities taught me resilience, time management, and unwavering dedication — qualities that now define my professional character.
</p>
<p>
Through formal education in cybersecurity and network security, combined with certifications such as CompTIA CySA+ and ISC2 CC, I have developed strong technical expertise in areas including:
</p>
<p>
- Threat detection and analysis<br>
- SIEM tools (QRadar, SentinelOne)<br>
- Centralized logging and monitoring<br>
- Vulnerability scanning and risk mitigation<br>
- Incident tracking and reporting<br>
- Network design and security fundamentals (VPNs, VLANs)
</p>
<p>
In addition to academic learning, I have continuously honed my skills through hands-on labs, independent projects, and real-world threat simulations. This blend of practical experience and theoretical knowledge enables me to detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
I believe that cybersecurity is not just about technology — it’s about proactive thinking, collaboration, and an endless commitment to learning. Every challenge has strengthened my ability to adapt, solve problems creatively, and protect organizations against emerging threats.
</p>
<p>
Today, I am eager to turn my hard-earned knowledge, work ethic, and passion for security into meaningful contributions for an organization that values innovation, resilience, and a proactive security posture. I am ready to take on new challenges, continue growing, and make a positive impact in the cybersecurity industry.
