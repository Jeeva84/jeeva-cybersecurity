  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <section class="about-me" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a highly motivated cybersecurity professional with strong hands-on experience in threat detection, security operations, and incident response. With a foundation built on formal education, industry-recognized certifications, and real-world projects, I bring a practical, resilient, and results-driven approach to cybersecurity challenges.</p>

    <p>My journey has been shaped by perseverance and passion. After moving to Canada, I took on multiple jobs to support my family while simultaneously pursuing my long-standing dream of working in cybersecurity. Balancing work, studies, and family responsibilities taught me resilience, time management, and unwavering dedication — qualities that now define my professional character.</p>

    <p>Through formal education in cybersecurity and network security, combined with certifications such as CompTIA CySA+ and ISC2 CC, I have developed strong technical expertise in areas including:</p>

    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Threat detection and analysis</li>
      <li>SIEM tools (QRadar, SentinelOne)</li>
      <li>Centralized logging and monitoring</li>
      <li>Vulnerability scanning and risk mitigation</li>
      <li>Incident tracking and reporting</li>
      <li>Network design and security fundamentals (VPNs, VLANs)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to academic learning, I have continuously honed my skills through hands-on labs, independent projects, and real-world threat simulations. This blend of practical experience and theoretical knowledge enables me to detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively and efficiently.</p>

    <p>I believe that cybersecurity is not just about technology — it’s about proactive thinking, collaboration, and an endless commitment to learning. Every challenge has strengthened my ability to adapt, solve problems creatively, and protect organizations against emerging threats.</p>

    <p>Today, I am eager to turn my hard-earned knowledge, work ethic, and passion for security into meaningful contributions for an organization that values innovation, resilience, and a proactive security posture. I am ready to take on new challenges, continue growing, and make a positive impact in the cybersecurity industry.</p>
