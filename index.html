  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    After moving to Canada, I took on multiple jobs to support my family, never losing sight of my long-standing passion for cybersecurity.  
    Despite the challenges of balancing work, studies, and family responsibilities, I remained committed to my dream — pursuing formal education and completing certifications in cybersecurity and network security.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey has been built on perseverance, continuous self-learning, and a genuine passion for protecting digital environments.  
    Through hands-on labs, real-world projects, and independent study, I have developed the skills necessary to detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I am eager to turn my hard-earned knowledge and dedication into meaningful contributions in the cybersecurity industry.  
    I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and every learning experience brings me closer to becoming the cybersecurity professional I aspire to be.
